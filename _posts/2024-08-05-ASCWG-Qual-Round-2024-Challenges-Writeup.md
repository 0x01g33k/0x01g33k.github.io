Hello guys, for the fifth year in a row I've had the honor to write the Digital Forensics Challenges for Arab Security Cyber War Games 2024. This year I wanted to introduce and teach the players about new topics in DF investigation such as SCADA traffic investigation and some deeper blockchain forensics.

So let's jump right in.

## First challenge: Level 4 disaster

Flag Format:```ASCWG{Attacker's_IP:Port-system_name-changed_value}```
