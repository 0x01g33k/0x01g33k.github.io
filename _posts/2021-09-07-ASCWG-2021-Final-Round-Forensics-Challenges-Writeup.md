Hello guys, for the seonc time in a row, I've had the honor of writing the DF challenges for the final round of ASCWG 2021, I've created 6 challenges for this round, 2 of them were warmup challenges, while the other 4 were DF challenges. I hope the players have nejoyed solving these challenges. 

<p> 1st challenge: ```I got some ***ngs attached.```

  The challenge is extremely easy and aims at teaching the players to learn the basic usage of ```strings``` utility in linux.
